# 🚨 **FLARE ALERT**: Fire Safety (disaster mitigation) System 🚗⚡


## Overview
FlareAlert AI is a cutting-edge disaster mitigation system designed to improve safety in industrial zones. It leverages **FlareFix**, a compact thermal IoT add-on, to upgrade existing CCTV cameras with:
- 🔥 Thermal heat detection
- 🧠 AI-based fire risk analysis
- 🚨 Smoke bomb/tampering recognition

## Features
- **🔥 Thermal Heat Detection**: Detect abnormal heat patterns before they escalate into fires.
- **🤖 AI-Powered Fire Risk Analysis**: Classify risks as normal, overheating, or fire.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Tampering Detection**: Recognize smoke bomb or camera obstruction attempts to prevent burglaries.
- **🖥️ Edge Computing with Google Coral TPU**: Real-time alerts with minimal latency, reducing dependency on cloud connectivity.
- **💰 Affordable and Scalable**: Low cost and easy deployment for India's industrial zones.

## Problem Statement
### Key Threats:
- **👩‍🔬 Human Casualties**: Overheating of machines and electrical components leading to fires.
- **💸 Asset Loss**: Destruction of expensive equipment and infrastructure due to delayed fire detection.
- **🚷 Burglaries**: Criminals using methods to obstruct CCTV cameras, bypassing traditional security.

### Why It Matters:
- India’s industrial zones are plagued by insufficient fire prevention systems.
- The need for a scalable, affordable solution to prevent fires, protect assets, and ensure safety.

## Proposed Solution: FlareAlert AI
FlareAlert AI uses **FlareFix** to enhance existing security camera systems, providing three key protections:
- **🔥 Fire Risk Detection**
- **💎 Asset Safety**
- **🛡️ Theft Prevention**

## Approach

### Technologies Used:
- **💻 Hardware**:
  - 🔥 FLIR Lepton 2.5/3.0 Thermal Sensor
  - 🤖 Google Coral TPU (Edge AI compute)
  - 🔧 Custom PCB with thermal camera mount (FlareFix)
  
- **💻 Software**:
  - 🐍 Python (AI model training with TensorFlow Lite)
  - 🖼️ OpenCV (Handling video and thermal streams)
  - ⚙️ Flask/Django (Backend alert system)
  - 📡 Firebase/MQTT (Real-time alert delivery)

### Workflow:
1. **📷 Thermal feed** captured via FlareFix.
2. **🧠 Edge inference** using Google Coral TPU for real-time classification.
3. **⚠️ Risk classification** into normal, overheating, tampering, or fire.
4. **🔔 Alert system** sends notifications to control rooms and emergency contacts.
5. **📊 Dashboard/Logs** maintained on a local server or cloud.

## Feasibility and Viability

### Feasibility:
- **🖥️ Hardware Compatibility**: FlareFix attaches to existing cameras with no need for replacements.
- **⚡ Edge Processing**: Google Coral TPU for low-latency AI processing.
- **💵 Cost**: The initial setup (~₹15k per camera) is affordable for Indian industrial sites.

### Potential Challenges:
- **⚠️ False Positives**: Due to environmental temperature changes.
- **⏳ Network Delays**: In remote industrial areas.
- **🛠️ Sensor Durability**: Harsh industrial environments may affect sensor longevity.

### Mitigation Strategies:
- **🤖 AI Model Optimization** with localized thermal datasets.
- **🌐 Edge+Cloud Hybrid Architecture**: Local processing with cloud sync for backup.
- **☔ Weatherproof Design**: Rugged, durable FlareFix casing for industrial conditions.

## Impact and Benefits

### Target Audience:
- **🏭 Factory Owners & Managers**: Reduced accidents and improved workplace safety.
- **💼 Insurance Companies**: Reduced payouts and incentivized adoption with premium discounts.
- **🌍 Local Communities**: Safer industrial zones with fewer fire-related disasters.

### Key Benefits:
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Social**: Saves lives through early detection, enhances safety culture.
- **💰 Economic**: Prevents significant asset loss, reduces insurance premiums.
- **🌱 Environmental**: Minimizes toxic emissions from fires, reduces carbon footprint.
